## BUILDING THE PROGRAM

This package includes Visual Studio 2003 solution/project files, as well as all
necessary dependencies (libraries and headers). Building the program should be
as easy as opening CreepyCrawlies.sln and hitting the "Build" button.

The executable is generated in the output folder. Both Debug and Release
versions are generated there.
